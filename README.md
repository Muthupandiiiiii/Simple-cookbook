The Cookbook Website project is a modern web-based application designed to simplify the cooking experience by offering users a dynamic platform to discover, manage, and generate recipes based on their preferences and available ingredients.The website empowers users to personalize their culinary journey
by selecting between vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals, exploring a rich collection of pre-existing
recipes, and even generating new ones using the ingredients they already have at home.
